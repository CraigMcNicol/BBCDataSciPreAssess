    "# Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous course we had a look at the process of preparing our dataset so that it can be easily ingested into one of many statistical learning models. We looked at how to identify whether our data is suitable for a supervised or unsupervised learning framework and also the differences between preparing our data for classification or regression models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will introduce key concepts around the use of machine-learning models while demonstrating the way a classification model can be used with a dataset. We will look at the process of choosing the most appropriate model, the way to train it with your data and finally how to evaluate it's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='estimation'></a>\n",
    "# Estimate the Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are in the supervised framework, the objective of each model we use for this project will be to formalise a relationship between the target output _y_ - what we want to forecast - and the the observable features _X_, using more or less complex formulas. These formulas will contain parameters that we need to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all algorithms we will minimise the  _loss function_ - this quantifies the distance between our model predictions (with a specific set of parameters) and the correct output _y_. The estimation process can be tricky as we are considering complex relations between our features and output.  Fortunately, we do not need to know much more than this as Python is doing all the maths for us! \n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested in learning more about optmisation and, in particular, the popular _gradient descent_ algorithm, there is a nice post here that uses excel to demonstrate: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/simple-understand-gradient-descent-algorithm.html\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='training_test'></a>\n",
    "# Training and Test Sets\n",
    " \n",
    "When training machine learning models - i.e. estimating their parameters - we want to avoid training the model on all of the possible data that we have available. This is to avoid creating a model that is tuned too specifically to our training data and will later not generalise - this is often called _overfitting_. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead we will spilt our data into _training sets_ and _test sets_. We then estimate the parameters of the model using the training sets and then evaluate performance using the test sets.  A popular approach is  _k-fold cross-validation_. Cross-validation is a clever way of carving up our dataset so that we can use all of it for training while still allowing us to evaluate or model using unseen data.   It works by initially splitting the dataset into  _k_ equally-sized sets (or \"folds\"). Then we loop through each of the _k_ folds of data (*k_i*) and do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove fold *k_i* and label that the test set.\n",
    "- Aggregate the remaining *k-1* folds and label that the training set.\n",
    "- Train the model using the data from the training set. \n",
    "- Evaluate the performance (compute the error) of the trained model using data from the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have trained all of our _k_ models we have computed _k_ errors or performance metrics (see the model evaluation part for more details on the metrics used). The average of these errors has been found to be a more robust metric than any of the individual error scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many complex problems and datasets the _bleeding_ of information from the test set into the training set by mistake can be a real problem. In such a case, our model would perform much worse in production than what we would otherwise expect. Very few data scientists have avoided the scenario where initially, they think they have trained a near perfect model and think they are a genius, only to realise later that there was a bug in the code and a leak of information between the training and test set exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: _if your model performance looks too good to be true - it probably is_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='model_selection'></a>\n",
    "# Model Selection\n",
    " \n",
    "The first decision you need to make in the model selection process within the supervised framework is whether you plan to use a _classifier_ or a _regressor_ model. As discussed in the previous course, classifiers make discrete predictions about a datapoint into a finite number of classes while regressors make linear predictions.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Different models work in different ways and are more or less suitable for different problems. Fortunately, however,  understanding these specific differences is not essential to solve your data problems. The python module `scikit learn` contains all of the models that you are likely to need and the format of the data it requires is standardised across models. This makes it very easy to try your data using a myriad of different models and choose the one that performs best on your data.\n",
    " \n",
    "In our current project we use both classifiers and regressors to predict engagement. In the classifier we simply try to predict whether someone has watched any content in the two-week period, while in the regressor we attempt to predict the number of minutes watched by the viewer within the two-week period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't tackle both prediction tasks here. This course focuses on classification and the next one will focus on regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='model_evaluation'></a>\n",
    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our models there are different metrics we can use. For classifiers, two popular metrics are _accuracy_ (percentage correct) and _the ROC curve_. The accuracy is the simplest metric but it gives us little insight into the behaviour of the model. ROC curves (and _the area under the curve_ statistic) give us a greater understanding of the separability of the data. For more details see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate our model at different stages in the model selection process. First, when training our model we will compute a test, or _out-of-sample error_, (actually _k_ errors after cross-validation). It's known as out-of-sample here because the predictions are made on data the model has never seen before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually models have also _hyperparameters_; these are parameters of the learning algorithms we use to train our model (parameters of the parameter-estimators). To find the best combination of hyperparameters, we usually try many different combinations (or perform a _grid search_ ) and select the combination that yields the lowest error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have selected the best set of hyperparameters for a given model, or the best kind of model for the data we have got, we can retrain a new model on the entire dataset and compute its _in-sample_ error; i.e. evaluate its predictions with the observed targets, keeping in mind that we have used this data to build the model this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most unbiased performance metric of a model will be it's out-of-sample error, but on a set of data that has not been used in any of the training phase, including the process of during hyper-parameter search. It is for this reason that it is considered best practice to hold out a further _validation set_ that can be used in lieu of the test set when searching for the optimal hyperparameter combination. This means that the _test set_ remains unaffected by the model fitting process (training and hyperparameter estimation) and can be used for a fully unbiased estimation of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when computing the performance of a model based on a given metric it's important to bare in mind what the performance of the most simple model would be. Usually we consider the completely random one as a baseline. Any model you build must be evaluated in terms of improvement over this performance. \n",

Single decision trees as documented above are built using the entirety of the training set while random forests generate multiple random subsets from the input data and train different trees with different subsets.

Random forests are also less prone to overfitting than decision trees as the trees they grow tend to be smaller and less complex. \n",

For smaller C values, the model will choose a hyperplane with a larger margin between the two classes; but as a result will misclassify more points.

As we have discussed previously, this is a bad sign and an indication that the dreaded overfitting has ocurred meaning the model will struggle to generalise well to unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When models do not fit correctly, there are usually steps we can take to adapt the data to the model or adapt the model to the data. For the former, SVM's usually benefit significantly from a _normalisation_ of their input (transforming the features to _z-scores_ of themselves), so this would be a logical next step to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the latter we could take a further look at the hyperparameters; we could try a finer gridsearch of the values closest to our current best value and also look at using a different type of _kernel_. The current kernel we are using is a non-linear one but using a non-linear kernel would make non-linear classification problems solvable (the original linear SVM can only solve linearly sepearable classes). However, this also increases the complexity of the model and therefore the potential for overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this course we have used a group of statistical learning models called classifiers. \n",
    "- We discussed how training a model is equivalent to estimating parameters.  \n",
    "- We discussed the importance of cross-validation; splitting our dataset into training sets (for parameter estimation) and test sets (for model evaluation). This process reduces the likelihood of overfitting; the phenomenon whereby our model is tuned to the underlying idiosynchrasies of the our training data, rather than the latent structure we are trying to model. This model therefore fails to generalise when it sees new data.\n",
    "- We discussed how models can have different hyperparameters and how these can be estimated.\n",
    "- Finally, we used our data to train and introduce four specific classifier models. We walked through the process of hyperparameters selection and the significance of the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next course we will have a look at a different class of statistical learning models: regressors."
